# Assigning Field Positions to Football Players using Machine Learning

Determining the best player position for a player is a key to the success of a team in soccer. The purpose of this research is to find out the best playing position of a player, by assessing the attributes of each player from the FIFA dataset. We propose the use of the FIFA Soccer video
game dataset, as there is a lack of a large scale dataset
with player attributes. To find out the best position of
each player, we have used various Machine Learning Models. 

This study is done as a part of Machine Learning Course(CSE-343/ECE-343) under Prof. Dr. Jainendra Shukla
